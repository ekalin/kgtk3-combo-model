Description: fix for GtkTreeModel in GtkCombo with GTK+ 3 - development files
 GTK+ 3.17.5 has removed the ability to select items in a GtkComboBox that
 have children. In GTK+ 2 an extra item was added to the combos, allowing
 the parent item to be selected, but this was removed in GTK+ 3.
 .
 This package provides a wrapper for GtkTreeModel's that include extra
 items such as those that used to be provided by GTK+ 2.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
